There are five assignments to give me hands-on experience on cpp and graphics. It is originated from MITOCW 6.837.

=========================================
The ZERO folder is for dealing with read obj files, run example:
./a0 < sphere.obj

The real interesting parts is the implenmenting the mesh simplification described in "Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics"; Please refer to my another repo:
https://github.com/Hcque/AMMesh/tree/main/src/hw9

======================
The ONE folder, run example:
./a0 swp/circle.swp
focused on curves and surfaces. The Bspline & bezer curve could be constructed both by change of basis and recursive algorithm. I partially complete the curve part this assignment.


========================
THE myrender folder combine the ray casting and recursive ray tracing , I  refer to  lecture notes & Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing: The Next Week serials.

=========================
NOtice TWO, THREE,FOUR I haven not do the work in these folders, remain start-code.
