# computer graphics 

There are five assignments to give me hands-on experience on cpp and graphics.

=========================================
The ZERO folder is for dealing with read obj files, The real interesting parts is the implenmenting the mesh simplification described in "Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics";
I gets familiarity on Eigen and various data structures. Particularity , I combine the hash table and priority queue to achieve O(1) entry deletion.
Other exploration detail:
1) to try different terms on the error function when selecting edges to eliminate. 
2) dfs, with bounded depth , for selection indirected neighbour edges 

The result on glimpse:

======================
The ONE folder is focused on curves and surfaces. The Bspline & bezer curve could be done both by change of basis and recursive algorithm. I partially complete this assignment.

=======================
The TWO is skipped.
=======================
The THREE is for particle simulation.
========================
THE FOUR combine the ray casting and recursive ray tracing , I also refer to  Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing: The Next Week serials.
